STG TS3Bot
==========

A litle project for our Teamspeak server. Its a bot that reacts to statuschanges of user or channels (switch, mute ...)

The core features of the bot are:
* Config through json file
* Log informations to MySQL
* Always keep track of the teamspeak server (for webviewer etc)
* Fire events on statuschanges (The native ts3 events aren't working well :P )

More features like a ranking system based on useractivity and a register-system for new users are planned
